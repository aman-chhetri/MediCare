<!-- ## 📶 Dataset

The trained dataset is originally from the `National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases`. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are `females` at least `21 years` old of `Pima Indian heritage`. The dataset can be found on [`Kaggle`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). It includes following health criteria:

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age (years)
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) -->
